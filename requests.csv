I have found the DTM and DSM for the location SP41 here http://environment.data.gov.uk/ds/survey/#/survey?grid=SP41. Can you give me access to the LiDAR point cloud that was used to create these products?

I am a Phd student in the Ecosystems Lab at Oxford University, and I am working in Wytham Woods, which is within that grid-square SP41. I am interested in modelling wind flow over the entire grid-square and I am collaborating with a group in Denmark who have done this. They use raw LiDAR point cloud data collected from a helicopter, and it would be much easier for us if we could have the point cloud instead of the DTM or DSM products. 

I understand that this data might be quite large, if you could tell me the size we can then work out how best to send it.

I should add that I am interested in this data for purely academic reasons to do with environmental research. There is no commercial interest. If a publication arises out of this work I am happy to give credit / co-authorship to anyone involved in data collection (I have collected LiDAR data myself and it is a hard job).

We would expect some mixture of hardware and software to be installed at a filling station, which would allow the pumps to be turned off for fuel which did not match the vehicles capabilities.

We got some free queries from dvlasearch.co.uk which allowed us to perform the demonstration, and show that in time and technology, this was possible.

Unfortunately, the current costs (7p per query)  of these extensive searches  (MOT data, engine size, model, ...) would be too prohibitive for the application we were
intending (the number of searches per week would be in the millions.)

Ofcom has been delegated the authority to investigate such complaints in accordance with the Broadcasting Code. Every week, Ofcom routinely publishes statistics in an aggregate format regarding the number of complaints filed and whether or not these matters require further investigation. This is useful, but it would be better if Ofcom could publish the full text of complaints received. Ofcom does this already on other occasions, such as when it consults with the public over the future of electromagnetic spectrum. In making this data more widely available, researchers would be able to track who is filling complaints (breaking them down by gender, geographical location - urban/rural setting, or frequency of dissatisfaction with programming, for instance) and identify whether these complaints are being filed organically or as a result of organised campaigns.

2) Determine country-level predictions of migration

b. Do immigrants from more health selective countries display faster health deterioration over longer residence in the United States?

The new tests used are stored instantly in electronic format and these along with epidemiological data should be quick and easy to compile as a spreadsheet or database.  This dataset would be extremely useful for analysis by interested parties.  It would make possible identification of emerging disease hot-spots, age vulnerability, and seasonal risks all cross-correlated; it would permit analysis of aspects of the efficiency of the tests used.  Although some of this is information is already published by HPE, the information is generally too limited to have predictive value or reveal subtleties.  To be of use to charities and the medico-scientific communities a comprehensive dataset is needed, excluding only patient and doctor identifiable information.  This can be easily removed making the whole database available for analysis, including individual test results which are fed directly to the computer from the test machine.  I would mention a rather important aspect of this topic.  Due to many years of dubious practices at Southampton Reference Laboratory, which that some consider underhand,  patients and medical professionals are sceptical about the accuracy and efficiency of testing for Lyme borreliosis in the UK.  Dr Tim Brooks who runs the RIPL testing lab for Lyme borreliosis has taken the effort to meet with patient representatives.  This may go some way towards rebuilding the trust that was lost.

By linking this into other data sets available,  they could also find stockists, proximity and product warnings should any be issued.

Most rail apps enable users to type these in rather than the full name, as once you know them and use a station regularly, this is much faster. However, the lat/lon location is also necessary for many uses, e.g. a user types in CBG and they get the location of the station.

We also use these, e.g. http://www.cyclestreets.net/journey/to/CBG/

OS OpenData is currently offered under the ""OS OpenData License"" [1] which comprises the standard ""Open Government License"" [2] together with an additional requirement to maintain attributions on sub-licensed data. This additional requirement means OS Open Data cannot be used as widely as other Government Open Data, creates additional burdens on data users, and potentially means OS OpenData cannot be mixed with data-sets licensed under the Open Database License [3]. I'd like to request that the OS simply use the standard Open Government License for their data, or at least explicitly state (within the license) that their additional clause does not affect users' ability to re-use the data under the Open Database License.

I refer especially to large Heavy Goods Vehicles who seemingly take perhaps 5-10 miles to overtake 'slow' vehicles on the nations motorway network. 
They will become frustrated by the vehicle they are following in the slow lane, then move to the middle lane to overtake... 
However, their bulk and mass means that they only travel approx. 1-2 miles per hour quicker than the vehicles they are overtaking. This means that for one HGV to overtake another can perhaps take the time required to circumnavigate the M25. This of course has a knock on effect. It means that 'white-van' men are forced to the fast lane to overtake themselves. But again, the mass of their vehicles, often in questionable mechanical order mean that they too take quite some time to overtake. This in turn causes further 'ripples', with a convoy of executive saloons (generally Audi's, Mercedes and BMW's with the occasional Ford and Vauxhall mixed in) and 'white-van' men all forced into the (now slower) fast lane. Generally speaking, a massive traffic jam has been caused, all because of a middle lane hog. 
What impact does this have on GDP? How much national output is waisted thanks to the middle-lane hogs? How much fuel is unnecessarily burned when 'cruising' speeds are interrupted by the sudden traffic jams that occur because of these middle lane hogs? How much extra wear and tear is created on the nations vehicles because of it?
